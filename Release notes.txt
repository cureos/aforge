AForge.NET 1.6.0 release notes
------------------------------
11.02.2008.


Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 32: Impossible to play some video files with Video.DirectShow.
  - Issue 33: Extending of Complex Image.
  - Issue 36: Stevenson-Arce dithering is useless.
  - Issue 39: Extracting blobs from color image.

* General
  - AForge.NET framework's license is updated and clarified. The license concentrates not on commercial
    vs. not-commercial software but on open vs. closed software. The framework is provided under dual
    license: GPL v2 for free and LGPL for a fee. Please, refer to License.txt document for more
    details.

  - AForge.Robotics.Lego library introduced, which provides classes to manipulate Lego
    NXT Mindstorm device. Test application is added to samples collection.

  - Documentation projects were updated for new versions of Sandcastle and Sandcastle Help File Builder.


* AForge.Imaging
  - Otsu thresholding is added (N. Otsu, "A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms",
    IEEE Trans. Systems, Man and Cybernetics 9(1), pp. 62–66, 19790).

  - Added initial implementation of Integral Image (P. Viola and M. J. Jones, "Robust real-time face detection",
    Int. Journal of Computer Vision 57(2), pp. 137–154, 2004).
    TODO: Some more methods are going to be added, which calculate features described by Viola and Jones.

  - Moravec corners detector is added (http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dparks/CornerDetector/mainMoravec.htm).

  - Horizontal and Vertical Intensity Statistics classes are added to the AForge.Imaging namespace. These classes
    provide information about horizontal and vertical distribution of pixel intensities.

  - Corners Marker filter added, which highlights corder of objects on the specified image using provided
    corners detection algorithm.

  - ComplexImage is extended with public property, which gives access to complex image's data. It gives
    possibility to implement additional classes to do filtering on ComplexImage.

  - IComplexFilter interface provided for filters, which work on complex Fourier transformed images.
    Frequency filter is moved out of ComplexImage to separate class.

  - Documentation has improved for binarization filters.

  - Stevenson-Arce dithering class is marked as obsolete since it is supposed to work with hexagonal pixel
    lattices. The filter is left for educational purpose.

  - BlobCounterBase class allows to extract blobs not only from binary/grayscale images, but from color
    images as well. Useful in the case if color image was grayscaled, thresholded, processed by blob counter
    and then it is required to extract blob from original image.

  - Iterative Threshold's performance improved by using image histogram instead of scanning entire image on
    each iteration.

  - FillRectangle() method added to Drawing class for filling rectangles on locked image.


* AForge.Math
  - Added Update() method to histogram classes, so it is possible to recalculate statistical values after
    direct changes in Values array of histogram.

  
* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Fixed the issue that it was not possible to play some videos. The issue was cause by fixing issue 22
    (1.5.1 version). Removing call of graph's Render() method solves the issue with freezing video after screen
    saver, but introduces another issue when playing some video files. The Render() method is adding not only
    renderer filter, but some other filters, which may be required. To configure this, a new property was
    introduced - PreventFreezing, which allows to select what is required - freezing preventing removing Render()
    call or not preventing leaving it.


* AForge.Controls
  - Histogram control is added to AForge.Controls namespace, which is originally taken from IPLab application,
    but extended with vertical histograms support.




AForge.NET 1.5.1 release notes
------------------------------
17.10.2007.

Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 22: Display change causes video to stop.
  - Issue 24: Blob detector size limits.


* AForge.Imaging
  - BlobCounterBase class was introduced to serve as a base for different blob counting algorithms.

  - Recursive blob counter was added. This blob counting algorithm is slower than existing one, but due its
    simplicity can be used for testing other algorithms. Improvements can be done.

  - Blob counter base class is updated to support not only Bitmap and BitmapData, but raw data in unmanaged
    memory.

  - Blob counter base class is updated to support blobs filtering by size.

  - Drawing class was introduced to keep different drawing routines, which can be applied to BitmapData.
    Rectangle routine is provided for now only.

  - ConnectedComponentsLabeling filter was updated to support blobs filtering by size.

  - BlobsFiltering filter was introduced to filter objects out of specified size range.


* AForge.Vision
  - ICountingMotionDetector interface was introduced, which describes interface for motion detection algorithms
    with objects counting support.

  - IZonesMotionDetector interface was introduced, which describes interface for motion detection algorithms
    with support of motion zones - zones, where motion detection should be done.

  - Counting motion detector was introduced, which allows to count moving objects and retrieve position and
    dimension of each object.


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - VideoCaptureDevice and FileVideoSource classes were updated - Render() method call of IGraphBuilder interface
    was removed. The method was completing graph with additional filters required for rendering, which were
    causing video stopping in the case of screen saver or workstation locking. Since we use Sample Grabber and
    we do our own rendering, the call was not actually required.


* Samples
  - Motion Detector sample was updated to demonstrate counting motion detector and motion zones configuration.

    what was causing incorrect mean value (in the case of histogram with large values).


* AForge.Imaging
  - Simple memory manager class added for allocation/dialocation unmanaged memory, which
    could be required for image processing filters.

  - New base class for partial filtering of color and grayscale images was introduced
    (FilterAnyToAnyPartial).

  - New base class for partial filtering of color and grayscale images was added
    (FilterAnyToAnyUsingCopyPartial). The class allows to do partial "in-place" filtering
    for those filters, which can not do direct manipulations with source image.

  - New base class for partial filtering of grayscale images was added (FilterGrayToGrayUsingCopyPartial).
    The class allows to do "in-place" filtering for those filters, which can not do direct manipulations
    with source image.
