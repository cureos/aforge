    quadrilateral area transformation to rectangular.
    
  - BlobCounterBase class is extended with GetBlobsLeftAndRightEdges() and GetBlobsTopAndBottomEdges() methods, which
    provide edge points of a blob. These routines are very useful with new AForge.Math.Geometry routines, which allow
    finding convex hull and quadrilateral corners.
    
  - BlobCounter and RecursiveBlobCounter are updated to be able to process color images as well (24 and 32 bpp).

AForge.NET Framework 2.0.1 release notes
----------------------------------------
19.09.2009.


Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 56: Changing activation functions
  - Issue 97: Request: Missing an event for when clip is done running
  - Issue 109: Comments for Hough line transform
  - Issue 110: GetMostIntensiveLines(count) returns null
  - Issue 112: Provide binaries as a .zip file
  
  
* AForge
  - Added zero initialization of allocated unmanaged images, since Marshal.AllocHGlobal() does not
    care about it.
    
  - Moving exceptions, which are related to connections to device, from AForge.Robotics.TeRK to AForge namespace,
    so they could be reused in other namespaces as well.
    
    
* AForge.Imaging
  - Fixed UnmanagedImage.FromManagedImage() method - it was allocating unmanaged image, but was not
    copying managed image to it.

  - Added documentation to UnmanagedImage to clarify its purpose.
  
  - Bug fix in SimplePosterization image processing filter.
  
  - Added black rectangle drawing in CannyEdgeDetector to remove unprocessed pixels. This is required in
    the case if the filter is applied in-place.
    
  - Created set of predefined common grayscaling algorithms, which are available as read only instances of
    Grayscale class. These predefined instances are available in Grayscale.CommonAlgorithms class. Old
    classes like GrayscaleBT709, GrayscaleRMY, GrayscaleY are marked as obsolete.
    
  - Both GetMostIntensiveLines() and GetLinesByRelativeIntensity() methods in HoughLineTransformation class
    were updated to return array of zero length instead of null in the case when there are no lines to return.
    
  - Updated documentation to HoughLineTransformation and HoughLine clarifying different aspects of Hough Line
    transformation. Provided sample code to highlight detected lines. Provided sample image with annotation
    to clarify meaning of Theta and Radius values of detected Hough lines.


* AForge.Imaging.Formats
  - Added registration of PPM extension as valid image in PNM format.
  
  - Added sample images for testing of AForge.Imaging.Formats namespace.
  

* AForge.Neuro
  - Added ability to change activation function of neuron/layer/network.
  

* AForge.Robotics.Lego
  - Added GetUltrasonicSensorsValue() method for NXT brick to read values of ultrasonic distance sensor.
  

* AForge.Robotics.TeRK
  - Added 2500 ms connection timeout to Qwerk classes. QwerkStart sample update to handle lost connection.
  

* AForge.Video
  - Added PlayingFinished event to IVideoSource interface. The event is fired in the case video
    stops by reaching end of video stream or by canceling by user.
  
  
* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Added VideoCapabilities property to VideoCaptureDevice class, which can be used to resolve supported
    frame sizes and maximum frame rates.


* AForge.Vision
  - MillisecondsPerBackgroundUpdate property is introduced in SimpleBackgroundModelingDetector, which
    allows to control background update on the base of time intervals, but not on the base of frames'
    counter. This allows to control background update in the way, which is not affected by variable frame
    rates. Also the method better handles those case, when video source has very low frame rate (where
    FramesPerBackgroundUpdate would not perform very well causing very long time to update background).
    
    
* Samples
  - Fixing FilterDemo application - added grayscaling before edge detectors (all edge detectors
    require grayscaling).

  - Video classes are updated to skip preparing new video frame, if nobody is subscribed for NewFrame
    event (decreases CPU usage if no subscribed clients).


* AForge.Vison
  - The namespace was completely redesigned to introduce motion detection and motion processing algorithms.
    In the past both these algorithms were part of each motion detection class, which was not flexible, not reusable
    and not extendable.


* Samples
  - Motion Detection sample application is updated to use new classes of the redesigned AForge.Vision namespace.
    Also added feature to show motion history.

    information about filters - which formats are supported by image processing
    filter and which format will be generated for result image.
    
  - Introduced support of unmanaged images - images, which are don't have relation
    with Bitmap and BitmapData classes from .NET. Unmanaged images are just pixel data
    in unmanaged memory.

    documents.
    
  - BlobCounterBase class now supports extracting of blobs' images, which size equals
    to source image size (this is configurable, so user may specify size of blobs'
    images).
   
  - Added PointedColorFloodFill, which fills image starting from the specified point
    with solid color. The filter supports tolerance, which allows filling areas with
    similar color.
     
  - Added PointedMeanFloodFill, which fills image starting from the specified point
    with mean value of the filled area. Size of the area to fill depends on
    specified tolerance.

  - Added optimized versions of Erosion and Dilatation filters, which are aimed for
    image processing with 3x3 structuring element and are optimized for certain
    image formats: BinaryDilatation3x3, BinaryErosion3x3, Dilatation3x3, Erosion3x3.


* AForge.Controls
  - Added PictureBox control, which is derived from .NET's control, but supports
    displaying of 16 bpp grayscale image and 48/64 color images, which are not
    handled by .NET routines.
     
  - Added VideoSourcePlayer control, which allows playing video feeds provided by
    classes implementing AForge.Video.IVideoSource inerface.
     
  - Added ColorSlider control, which is aimed for selection of RGB color value
    and ranges.
     
     
* AForge.Genetic
  - Added support for migration between genetic populations. User may run several
    population in deferent threads for example and perform members' migration
    from time to time. See Population.Migrate() method.
     
  - DoubleArrayChromosome class is extended with more advanced crossover and mutation
    operators (see docs for details).


* AForge.Neuro
  - Added support of using network classes from multiple threads (thread safety).

    AForge.Parallel.For().
     
  - Added Fuzze Set Sample and FuzzyAGV sample applications, which demonstrate
    usage of new AForge.Fuzzy namespace.
     
  - Added ImageViewer sample application, which demostrates usage of new
    AForge.Imaging.Formats namespace.
     
  - Added QwertStart sample application, which demonstrates basics of using
    new AForge.Robotics.TeRK namespace and performs basic manipulations
    of Qwerk.
     
  - Added Player sample, which demonstrates usage of AForge.Video.* namespaces
    for playing different video source.
     
  - Added Two Cameras Test sample application, which demonstrates how to open
    two web cameras simultaneously. Also may serve as useful utility of testing
    two cameras from the same manufacturer (some cameras do not support dual
    setup, so it is nice to have something to that quickly).


* and just many smaller updates in this version ...

    exhaustive search algorithm. It can be used to search for a template in search image or to compare
    two images.

  - IBlockMatching interface is introduced for blcok matching algorithms. As a first class, which
    implements this interface, an ExhaustiveBlockMatching class is provided, which does exhaustive
    search of blocks from source image in search image within specified radius.

  - Drawing class is extended to draw lines.

  - Convolution filter is updated to allow specification of divisor, so convolution could be divided not
    only by automatically calculated divisor, but by custom divisor as well.

  - Correlation filter is removed to avoid any confusion. The filter was doing the same as convolution
    filter, but with mirrored/flipped kernel.


* AForge.Robotics.Lego
  - RCXBrick class introduced, which provide functionality to perform some manipulations with Lego RCX
    Mindstorm brick.

  - NXTBrick is moved to Lego nampespace from Lego.NXT. Its interface is refactored a bit to have more

  - Issue 62: ImageStatisticsHSL's check for black pixel isn't proper.


* AForge.Imaging
  - Small tuning of HSL image statistics class - to check if pixel is black it is required to check only
    luminance component (all non-black pixels will form non-zero luminance).


* AForge.Vision
  - HighPrecisionBackgroundModeling class is fixed to handle correctly the case when noise suppression is
    off and motion edges highlighting is on.

  - Added more checks to handle the case when user passes motion zones array with 0 elements.

  - Motion zone routines are updated to lock motion detector object (this) instead of motionZones variable
    since it may be null and lead to exception.


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Added functionality to display property page of video capture device, which allows changing its
    settings provided by driver (contrast, brightness, frame size, etc).

  - VideoCaptureDevice class is extended with DesiredFrameRate and DesiredFrameSize properties, which
    allow to configure frame rate and size. Class is reworked to create capture graph using ICaptureGraphBuilder2
    interface. The PreventFreezing property is dropped since it is no longer required with new class implementation.

    to collect blobs without initialized image, and ExtractBlobsImage(), which allows to extract blob's
    image. Blob class got new additional ID property.

  - Blob class is changed so it does not implement IDisposable interface any more. Use is responsible for
    blob's image disposing.

  - ExtractBiggestBlob filter is introduced, which extracts the biggest blob from the provided source
    image (or from original image if appropriate property is set).

AForge.NET 1.6.0 release notes
------------------------------
11.02.2008.


Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 32: Impossible to play some video files with Video.DirectShow.
  - Issue 33: Extending of Complex Image.
  - Issue 36: Stevenson-Arce dithering is useless.
  - Issue 39: Extracting blobs from color image.

* General
  - AForge.NET framework's license is updated and clarified. The license concentrates not on commercial
    vs. not-commercial software but on open vs. closed software. The framework is provided under dual
    license: GPL v2 for free and LGPL for a fee. Please, refer to License.txt document for more
    details.

  - AForge.Robotics.Lego library introduced, which provides classes to manipulate Lego
    NXT Mindstorm device. Test application is added to samples collection.

  - Documentation projects were updated for new versions of Sandcastle and Sandcastle Help File Builder.


* AForge.Imaging
  - Otsu thresholding is added (N. Otsu, "A threshold selection method from gray-level histograms",
    IEEE Trans. Systems, Man and Cybernetics 9(1), pp. 62–66, 19790).

  - Added initial implementation of Integral Image (P. Viola and M. J. Jones, "Robust real-time face detection",
    Int. Journal of Computer Vision 57(2), pp. 137–154, 2004).
    TODO: Some more methods are going to be added, which calculate features described by Viola and Jones.

  - Moravec corners detector is added (http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dparks/CornerDetector/mainMoravec.htm).

  - Horizontal and Vertical Intensity Statistics classes are added to the AForge.Imaging namespace. These classes
    provide information about horizontal and vertical distribution of pixel intensities.

  - Corners Marker filter added, which highlights corder of objects on the specified image using provided
    corners detection algorithm.

  - ComplexImage is extended with public property, which gives access to complex image's data. It gives
    possibility to implement additional classes to do filtering on ComplexImage.

  - IComplexFilter interface provided for filters, which work on complex Fourier transformed images.
    Frequency filter is moved out of ComplexImage to separate class.

  - Documentation has improved for binarization filters.

  - Stevenson-Arce dithering class is marked as obsolete since it is supposed to work with hexagonal pixel
    lattices. The filter is left for educational purpose.

  - BlobCounterBase class allows to extract blobs not only from binary/grayscale images, but from color
    images as well. Useful in the case if color image was grayscaled, thresholded, processed by blob counter
    and then it is required to extract blob from original image.

  - Iterative Threshold's performance improved by using image histogram instead of scanning entire image on
    each iteration.

  - FillRectangle() method added to Drawing class for filling rectangles on locked image.


* AForge.Math
  - Added Update() method to histogram classes, so it is possible to recalculate statistical values after
    direct changes in Values array of histogram.

  
* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - Fixed the issue that it was not possible to play some videos. The issue was cause by fixing issue 22
    (1.5.1 version). Removing call of graph's Render() method solves the issue with freezing video after screen
    saver, but introduces another issue when playing some video files. The Render() method is adding not only
    renderer filter, but some other filters, which may be required. To configure this, a new property was
    introduced - PreventFreezing, which allows to select what is required - freezing preventing removing Render()
    call or not preventing leaving it.


* AForge.Controls
  - Histogram control is added to AForge.Controls namespace, which is originally taken from IPLab application,
    but extended with vertical histograms support.




AForge.NET 1.5.1 release notes
------------------------------
17.10.2007.

Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 22: Display change causes video to stop.
  - Issue 24: Blob detector size limits.


* AForge.Imaging
  - BlobCounterBase class was introduced to serve as a base for different blob counting algorithms.

  - Recursive blob counter was added. This blob counting algorithm is slower than existing one, but due its
    simplicity can be used for testing other algorithms. Improvements can be done.

  - Blob counter base class is updated to support not only Bitmap and BitmapData, but raw data in unmanaged
    memory.

  - Blob counter base class is updated to support blobs filtering by size.

  - Drawing class was introduced to keep different drawing routines, which can be applied to BitmapData.
    Rectangle routine is provided for now only.

  - ConnectedComponentsLabeling filter was updated to support blobs filtering by size.

    with support of motion zones - zones, where motion detection should be done.

  - Counting motion detector was introduced, which allows to count moving objects and retrieve position and
    dimension of each object.


* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - VideoCaptureDevice and FileVideoSource classes were updated - Render() method call of IGraphBuilder interface
    was removed. The method was completing graph with additional filters required for rendering, which were
    causing video stopping in the case of screen saver or workstation locking. Since we use Sample Grabber and
    we do our own rendering, the call was not actually required.


* Samples
  - Motion Detector sample was updated to demonstrate counting motion detector and motion zones configuration.

    what was causing incorrect mean value (in the case of histogram with large values).


* AForge.Imaging
  - Simple memory manager class added for allocation/dialocation unmanaged memory, which
    could be required for image processing filters.
