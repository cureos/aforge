AForge.NET 1.5.0 release notes
------------------------------
16.09.2007.

Version updates and fixes:

* Fixed registered issues/requests:
  - Issue 8 : Applying filter to image part.
  - Issue 23: OilPainting filter partialy processes image.
  - Issue 25: Mirror filter.
  - Issue 27: Image statistics reports negative mean value for big images.


* AForge.Math
  - AForge.Math.Statistics.Mean() was fixed to use double for mean calculation instead of int,
    what was causing incorrect mean value (in the case of histogram with large values).


* AForge.Imaging
  - Simple memory manager class added for allocation/dialocation unmanaged memory, which
    could be required for image processing filters.

  - Added new base class (FilterGrayToGrayUsingCopy) for filtering grayscale images. The
    class allows to do "in-place" filtering for those filters, which can not do direct
    manipulations with source image.

  - Added new base class (FilterAnyToAnyUsingCopy) for filtering color grayscale images.
    The class allows to do "in-place" filtering for those filters, which can not do direct
    manipulations with source image.

  - New interface was presented for filters, which can be applied to specified rectangle of
    source image (IInPlacePartialFilter).

  - New base class for partial filtering of color images was introduced (FilterColorToColorPartial).

  - New base class for partial filtering of grayscale images was introduced (FilterGrayToGrayPartial).

  - New base class for partial filtering of color and grayscale images was introduced
    (FilterAnyToAnyPartial).

  - New base class for partial filtering of color and grayscale images was added
    (FilterAnyToAnyUsingCopyPartial). The class allows to do partial "in-place" filtering
    for those filters, which can not do direct manipulations with source image.

  - New base class for partial filtering of grayscale images was added (FilterGrayToGrayUsingCopyPartial).
    The class allows to do "in-place" filtering for those filters, which can not do direct manipulations
    with source image.

  - Classes marked as depricated: FilterGrayToGrayNewSameSize, FilterAnyToAnyNewSameSize.

  - Filters converted to in-place filters: Bottom Hat, Top Hat.

  - Filters converted to partial filters: Sepia, Rotate Channels, Channel filtering, Color filtering,
    Euclidean color filtering, Replace channel, Brightness correction, Contrast correction,
    HSL filtering, HSL linear, Hue modifier, Saturation correction, YCbCr filtering, YCbCr linear,
    YCbCr replace channel, Ordered dithering, Threshold, Iterative threshold, Threshold with carry,
    SIS Threshold, Salt and Pepper noise, Additive noise, Invert, Pixellate, Color Remapping,
    Gamma Correction, Levels Linear, Texturer

  - Filters converted to in-place partial filters: Binarization filters based on error
    diffusion dithering, Correlation, Gaussian Blur, Sharpen Ex, Hit-And-Miss, Jitter,
    Oil painting, Median, Erosion, Dilatation, Closing, Opening, AdaptiveSmooth, ConservativeSmoothing,
    Simple skeletonization.

  - Bug is fixed in Canny Edge Detector related to incorrect checking of pixel neighbors.
    The bug was possible to see only on images with odd width.

  - Oil Painting filter fixed to clear intensities array correctly (issue 23).

  - Mirror filter added, which allows to do vertical and/or horizontal mirroring (issue 25).




AForge.NET 1.4.2 release notes
------------------------------
01.08.2007.

Version updates and fixes:

* General
  - Added new namespaces: Video.DirectShow;

* AForge.Video.DirectShow
  - VideoCaptureDevice class added to access local video capture devices like USB webcams
    using DirectShow;

    video codecs than Video for Windows so this class allows to play wider range of video
    files).
